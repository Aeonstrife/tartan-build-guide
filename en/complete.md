# Switch soldering

## note

Depending on the accuracy of the mounting holes, the switch may stick diagonally. (Especially, it stands out with the MOD key such as long Shift.) After fitting the switch once, check it, and if it becomes slanted, we recommend the following measures.

- Cut off the plastic foot of the switch
- Widen the holes in the board

Unplug the USB cable and solder the switch. You can choose from several layouts such as ANSI, ISO, hhkb, and split BackSpace.
Check the layout before soldering.

If the switch does not interfere, any layout you choose will work by rewriting the firmware.

## PCB Layout

You can choose ISO layout instead of the ANSI layout
